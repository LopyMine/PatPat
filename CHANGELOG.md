# v1.2.1 Update

This update was created primarily to protect you from unexpected bans from servers and their anti-cheat systems. [About problem](https://discord.com/channels/1090757125514461276/1090758804913803304/1400210342470221905)

## Proximity packets
- Option has been forcibly disabled (it can be re-enabled in the settings)
- Added editable whitelist/blacklist of servers on which Proximity Packets will work

We still believe in this feature, so we are not removing it from the mod at this time, but you should be aware of the risks when using it! (This applies more to large servers with anti-cheat software)

## Translation
- Added Ukrainian language (MrLemonHog)
- Added translators in Mod Menu

## Misc
- Fixed permission for `ratelimit` command
- In output ignore command changed color for entity type to gold
- Updated ProxLib to 0.2.4
