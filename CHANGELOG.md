# v1.2.2 Update

## Important (About false bans)
First, in this version we fixed sending hand swing packets in spectator mode,
which may cause false bans on server (CubeCraft especially).
Also, happy news, proximity packets allowed on CubeCraft, you won't be banned from CubeCraft anti-cheat by using it.
Can't say about other servers, just letting you know.
In fact, if you were banned for these proximity packets on CubeCraft, it was for the hand swing packets.
This was revealed after talking to the CubeCraft developers.
But remember, that's only for CubeCraft, can't say anything about other servers!!!

## Added
- Added a new "PVP Mode" option in "Fun" group. With it, you can also pat the entity after attacking it (that's really funny, try it)

## Translations
- Updated en_us and ru_ru for this update
