# âš¡ PatPat Plugin

If you have non-Fabric server, you can install PatPat Plugin on your Bukkit/Spigot/Paper server! This Plugin just provides the server-side functionality of the PatPat for non-Fabric Servers.

For now, the PatPat Plugin should support most of the currently available server cores, such as Bukkit, Spigot, Paper and on other their forks. I recommend just to test it on your server.

**If you see that this plugin doesn't work at your server, please open issue about it at [**Github Issues**](https://github.com/LopyMine/PatPat-Plugin/issues) page.** Currently, in plans to add support for Velocity servers.

# ðŸ“” Open Source

All code of PatPat Mod and Plugin is open source. Anyone can read and verify it!
